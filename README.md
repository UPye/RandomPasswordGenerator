## Credits
I want to thank Cody, Kevin, and Kip. We consolidated code together to minimize how much code we were using, and I want to thank the people who created the https://randojs.com/ site because it helped make my password generator more random with the characters. Before implementing the code from that link, the randomized code we used used all numbers, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, and 1 special character for ALL password. Now, it is a fully functioning random password generator, and every password is completely different.
