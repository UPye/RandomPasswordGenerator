# Password Generator Starter Code

Worked with Cody, Kevin, and Kip. We consolidated code together to minimize how much code we were using. I implemented a randomizer script from https://randojs.com/1.0.0.js to make the code more random because it wasn't random enough. Before implementing the code from that link, the randomized code we used used all numbers, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, and 1 special character for ALL password. Now, it is a fully functioning random password generator, and every password is completely different.

## Credits
Thanks for all the help from Carlos for making this happen with GIT and GITHUB; changing computers in the middle of all this can really put a screw in things.
